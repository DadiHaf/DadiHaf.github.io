                        <h3>Saga</h3>
                        <p>The idea for Nuka-World was born on a Memorial Day weekend as John-Caleb Bradberton watched hundreds of American's enjoying an ice cold Nuka-Cola at the fairgrounds. He thought, "A day like this should be everyday!" and the idea for Nuka-World was born.
                        </p><p>
                        Construction was started in July 2049, and despite everyone's doubts, opened less than a year later on May 1, 2050. Nuka-World featured Nuka-Town U.S.A. and Kiddie Kingdom as its two main attractions. Nuka-World's opening day saw tremendous success with over 40,000 tickets sold.
                        </p><p>          
                        Due to the overwhelming success, the plans to expand Nuka-World were immediately set in motion. Dry Rock Gulch opened in 2058, followed by Safari Adventure in 2067. On both occasions, the amount of visitors almost doubled overnight. The Galactic Zone, the last and most ambitious of the planned parks, opened to the public in 2072.

                            <p>Kiddie Kingdom was the original featured park of Nuka-World. Famous for its sugary dessert theme, John-Caleb Bradberton wanted to focus on a place for younger children to enjoy.
                            </p><p>
                                Some of Kiddie Kingdom's more popular attractions include the Ferris Wheel, King Cola's Castle, Nuka Racers and the Fun House.
                            </p><p>
                                Kiddie Kingdom is located northeast of Nuka-Town U.S.A.

                        </P><p>
                            Currently, the Bottling Plant is featuring Nuka-Cola's latest product, Nuka-Cola Quantum

                        <p>Dry Rock Gulch was the first of Nuka-World's planned expansions. Its grand opening was held on Memorial Day weekend of May 2058 which coincided with the introduction of Nuka-Cola Wild to the public. Inspired by John-Caleb Bradberton's own love of the Wild West as a child, and as a celebration of the Nuka-Cola Wild soft drink, Dry Rock Gulch takes you back in time to the days of cowboys, horses and saloons.
                        </p><p>
                            Dry Rock Gulch features Mad Mulligan's Minecart Coaster and an outdoor theater where you can enjoy child friendly entertainment.
